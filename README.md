# CLI Chat App with Google Gemini

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) chat application built in Go that utilizes the Google Gemini API for natural language processing.  It allows you to have conversations with the Gemini model, storing the conversation history in a local SQLite database.

## Features

*   **Multiple Conversations:**  Create and manage multiple separate conversations.
*   **Persistent History:**  Conversation history is stored in a local SQLite database, so you can resume conversations later.
*   **Model Selection:** Choose from available Gemini models (if your API key has access to multiple models).
*   **Streaming Responses:**  The application displays the agent's responses in a streaming fashion, providing a more interactive experience.
*   **Automatic Title Generation:** Conversation titles are automatically generated by the Gemini API based on the initial user message.
*   **Clean Code Structure:** The code is organized into separate modules for database interaction (`database`), Gemini API communication (`gemini`), conversation management (`conversation`), and utility functions (`utils`).

## Prerequisites

*   **Go:** You need to have Go installed on your system (version 1.20 or later is recommended).  [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
*   **Google Cloud Project and API Key:**
    *   Create a Google Cloud project: [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)
    *   Click on the "Get API Key" button.
    *   Create an API key for your project.
    **Important:** For production use, restrict your API key to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Git** (optional, but recommended for cloning the repository).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download the Code):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anishgowda21/gemini-cli-app.git
    cd gemini-cli-app
    ```
    If you don't use Git, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
    This command downloads and installs the necessary Go packages (GORM, the Gemini API client, `godotenv`, and `uuid`).

3.  **Create a `.env` File:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.  Add the following line, replacing `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
    ```

    **Important:**  The `.gitignore` file is set up to prevent the `.env` file from being committed to your Git repository.  This is crucial for security, as you should *never* commit API keys to version control.

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/gemini-cli-app
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    go run .
    ```

## Usage

The application presents a simple menu:

1. **List conversations** - View all your saved conversations
2. **Start new conversation** - Begin a new chat with Gemini
3. **Continue a conversation** - Resume an existing conversation
4. **List available models** - See which Gemini models you can use
5. **Delete conversation** - Remove a conversation and its messages
6. **Exit** - Close the application

### Basic Commands:
- Type `/bye` to end a conversation
- Your conversation history is automatically saved
- Messages are displayed with "You:" and "Agent:" prefixes


## Limitations

- Currently supports text-only interactions
- Requires stable internet connection
- API rate limits apply based on your Google Cloud project settings
